        IndiGo is India's largest passenger airline with a market share of 55.5% as of January, 2022. We primarily operate in India’s domestic air travel market as a low-cost carrier with focus on our three pillars – offering low fares, being on-time and delivering a courteous and hassle-free experience. IndiGo has become synonymous with being on-time.<br><br>

Since our inception in August 2006, we have grown from a carrier with one plane to a fleet of 276 aircraft today. A uniform fleet for each type of operation, high operational reliability and an award winning service make us one of the most reliable airlines in the world.<br><br>

IndiGo has a total destination count of 97 with 73 domestic destinations and 24 International. This includes Pantnagar (PGH) and Kadapa (CDP) which are now open for sale.<br><br>
